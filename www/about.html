 <h1>About the placed based carbon calculator</h1>
<h2>What is the placed-based carbon calculator?</h2>
<p>The calculator estimates the average carbon footprint per person for each LSOA in England and Wales. 
It focuses on local emissions which can be attributed to the residents of the LSOA. So, it excludes many 
sources of carbon emissions. For example, the emissions from public services and private businesses. Instead 
the calculator focuses on emission which local communities have the most control over such as the gas and 
electricity we use in our homes and the fuel for our cars. In total this covers about 40% of the UKâ€™s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>As well as calculating the local carbon footprint the calculator also gives useful information about 
contributing factors such as how well insulated homes are or how far the average person drives per year.</p>
<h2>How do you use the place-based carbon calculator?</h2>
<p>To use the calculator simple pan and zoom the map to your area of interest and click on any of the areas to get a popup report. </p>
<h2>Who created the place-based carbon calculator?</h2>
<p>The calculator was developed by Dr Malcolm Morgan at the University of Leeds, as part of research Funded 
by the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions.</p>
<h2>Where does the data come from and how was the carbon footprint calculated?</h2>
<p>The  placed-based carbon calculator is an open-source project and the code is on GitHub. The data was 
collected from a wide range of sources, please see the data sources page for more details.</p>
