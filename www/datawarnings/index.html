<p>This page highlights some know issues with the data used in the PBCC.</p>

<h2>Cosmopolitan student neighbourhoods with very low footprints</h2>

<p>Some student neighbourhoods have very low carbon footprints. This can be due to student accommodation being classified a commercial rather than domestic buildings.  Thus the gas and electricity consumption of these areas is being undercounted. Also, students often appear to have a low income in relation to their consumption as money/gifts from parents and student loans/grants do not count towards the traditional definition of income. Thus, income is not a good way to understand students’ carbon footprints, especially international students where data is extremely limited.</p>

<p>These issues don’t affect all student areas. It is likely that student neighbourhoods generally have below-average carbon footprints due to their low levels of car ownership and smaller living spaces.</p>

<p>Within the PBCC, we have suppressed the overall carbon footprint grade to reflect the low certainty of the data in the affected areas.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<p>E01028521, E01025690, E01026860, E01013378, E01006747, E01033221, E01011678, E01005210, E01033233, E01009635, E01033634, E01009642, E01017986, E01008407, E01013816, E01017958, E01006513, E01009641, E01033197, E01006512, E01017034, E01017032, E01005062, E01033583, E01013973, E01033553, E01008406, E01033006, E01011229, E01005209, E01016899, E01033005, E01032797, E01008397, E01008068, E01005284, E01005231, E01033554, E01025105, E01033762, E01033561, E01011670, E01017140, E01033724, E01026133, E01009284, E01013648, E01033556</p>

<h2>London Olympics Park</h2>

<p>The former site of the Olympic Park now has a large number of flats. Superficially, the low carbon footprint looks plausible due to the high-energy efficiency of these flats and the low car ownership. However, the income data does not reflect these areas new high-value status. It is likely that the data is simply out of date for this area and does not accurately reflect the current situation.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<p>E01033583</p>

<h2>Areas with a large number of vans</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly large numbers of vans. It is likely that a company has registered an entire fleet to a single address. However, these vans actually operate across the country. In these areas, we have suppressed the total carbon footprint and vans grades.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>
<p>E01016281, E01016767, E01015503, E01019556, E01010151, E01033484, E01009320</p>


<h2>Areas with a large number of cars</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly large numbers of cars. It is likely that a company has registered an entire fleet to a single address. However, these cars actually operate across the country. In these areas, we have suppressed the total carbon footprint and cars grades.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<h2>Areas with very low electricity use</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly low electricity use. It is likely that domestic use has been miss-classified as commercial use.</p>
