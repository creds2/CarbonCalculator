<p>This page highlights some know issues with the data used in the PBCC.</p>

<h2>Cosmopolitan student neighbourhoods with very low footprints</h2>

<p>Some student neighbourhoods have very low carbon footprints. This can be due to student accommodation being classified a commercial rather than domestic buildings.  Thus the gas and electricity consumption of these areas is being undercounted. Also, students often appear to have a low income in relation to their consumption as money/gifts from parents and student loans/grants do not count towards the traditional definition of income. Thus, income is not a good way to understand students’ carbon footprints, especially international students where data is extremely limited.</p>

<p>These issues don’t affect all student areas. It is likely that student neighbourhoods generally have below-average carbon footprints due to their low levels of car ownership and smaller living spaces.</p>

<p>Within the PBCC, we have suppressed the overall carbon footprint grade to reflect the low certainty of the data in the affected areas.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<h2>London Olympics Park</h2>

<p>The former site of the Olympic Park now has a large number of flats. Superficially, the low carbon footprint looks plausible due to the high-energy efficiency of these flats and the low car ownership. However, the income data does not reflect these areas new high-value status. It is likely that the data is simply out of date for this area and does not accurately reflect the current situation.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<p>E01033583</p>

<h2>Areas with a large number of vans</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly large numbers of vans. It is likely that a company has registered an entire fleet to a single address. However, these vans actually operate across the country. In these areas, we have suppressed the total carbon footprint and vans grades.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>
<p>E01016281, E01016767, E01015503, E01019556, E01010151, E01033484, E01009320, E01011470</p>


<h2>Areas with a large number of cars</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly large numbers of cars. It is likely that a company has registered an entire fleet to a single address. However, these cars actually operate across the country. In these areas, we have suppressed the total carbon footprint and cars grades.</p>

<p><b>LSOAs Affected:</b></p>

<h2>Areas with very low electricity use</h2>

<p>There are a few LSOAs with implausibly low electricity use. It is likely that domestic use has been miss-classified as commercial use.</p>
